Interactive, SQLite-backed incident manager for Digital Forensics & Incident Response (DFIR) with an **application security** focus.

  - Evidence map (optional SHA-256 hashing)
  - Timeline (UTC ISO-8601)
  - Executive checklist
- **SQLite persistence** (`db/ir.sqlite3`) so you can return and edit later
- **Pre-populated** tasks & checklist aligned to the playbook
- **Exports** to:
  - Markdown (`exports/incident_<ID>/incident_report.md`)
  - HTML (`exports/incident_<ID>/incident_report.html`)
  - PDF (`exports/incident_<ID>/incident_report.pdf`) ‚Äî if `reportlab` is installed
- **Incident ID format:** `xxxx-YYYY-MM-DD` (4 random lowercase letters/digits + date). You can edit it later if needed.
